NFL Player Data Analysis

Overview

This project demonstrates data analytics and visualization techniques applied to a dataset containing NFL player performance data. The analysis aims to uncover insights such as player performance, trends, injury status distribution, and correlations between key metrics like total yards and touchdowns. This project showcases my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data using Python and popular data science libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Key Features

Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing values to ensure accurate analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarizing the dataset and identifying key trends.
Visualization: Creating meaningful visualizations to showcase the distribution and correlation of different metrics.
Statistical Analysis: Analyzing correlations between player performance metrics and understanding the relationships between key features.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes NFL player performance statistics, such as:

Player Name
Position
Total Yards
Touchdowns
Pass Completion Percentage (for quarterbacks)
Injury Status
And more...
The dataset is saved in a CSV format and can be easily updated with new player data.

Libraries Used

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting.
seaborn: For advanced statistical visualizations and better-looking plots.
Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nfl-data-analysis.git
cd nfl-data-analysis
Install the required dependencies:
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
How to Use

Ensure you have the dataset (NFL_Data.csv) saved in the correct directory.
Run the nfl_data_analysis.py script using Python:
python nfl_data_analysis.py
The script will load the dataset, perform analysis, and generate visualizations showing key insights.
Analysis Features

Top Players by Total Yards: Displays the top 5 players with the highest total yards.
Top Players by Touchdowns: Displays the top players by total touchdowns scored.
Distribution of Total Yards: Shows the frequency of total yards scored by all players.
Total Yards vs Touchdowns: Scatter plot comparing total yards and touchdowns, categorized by player position.
Injury Status Distribution: Count and visualization of players based on their injury status.
Quarterback Performance: Visualization of pass completion percentage for quarterbacks.
Correlation Analysis: Examines the correlation between total yards and touchdowns.
Example Output

After running the script, you will see visualizations like:

A histogram of total yards distribution.
A scatter plot comparing total yards and touchdowns by player position.
A heatmap of the correlation between total yards and touchdowns.
